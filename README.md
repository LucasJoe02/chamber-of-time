A Cornell box with vairous ray-traced objects built in OpenGL 

## Description

This OpenGL 4 project shows examples of many different ray-tracing techniques as models in a Cornell box

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* OpenGL
* GLUT
* QtCreator

### Installing

* You can install the webapp by downloading this repo as a zip folder
* Extract the folder on your machine

### Executing program

* Open QtCreator (preinstalled on lab computers.)
* Go to File -> Open File or Project -> navigate to project file -> select CMakeLists.txt
* Select the Desktop kit ->Configure Project
* Ensure the images/textures are placed in the build directory
* Click the monitor in the bottom left of QtCreator just above the green arrow
* Select Debug and then RayTracer.out
* Press the green arrow to build and run the project
* If there are errors in building and running then navigate to the projects tab on the left
* Then change the build directory to the source directory of the project
* Another solution is to move the image files into the build directory
